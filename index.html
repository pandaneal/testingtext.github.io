INT. APARTMENT - DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A round mirror sitting on a cluttered vanity. 
Disco lights flash across the clutter. We hear the opening bars of KARAOKE MUSIC. 
BEGIN OPENING CREDITS. 
Through the hazy mirror, we watch as a Chinese family of three, THE WANG's, sing karaoke together. They can't agree on a song but they settle on "Barbie Girl" by Aqua. 
They are awkward and off pitch. But it's sweet. A brief snapshot of happiness. Then, like a flip of a switch2 INT. APARTMENT - DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM - MORNING SNAP. 
EVELYN WANG bursts into the room, a 55 year old Chinese woman in an over sized t-shirt, streaks of gray in her hair, and thin outdated designer glasses. 
The tiny dining room is overpopulated with workout equipment, self-help and inspirational business books, 
an old TV playing a Chinese soap opera, a live security feed for the laundromat downstairs, a rice cooker spewing steam, & a microwave with one minute to go. 
It is a still life of chaos. Evelyn sits and looks down at years of tax documents and old receipts. Picking up one of the receipts, she decides which pile to place it on. 
She changes her mind and holds the receipt in the air, frozen by indecision. A hand enters frame and grabs hold of the receipt and playfully throws it into a pile. 
WAYMOND, Evelyn's husband in transition lens glasses and an ill fitting polo shirt, smiles down at her. Note: Chinese dialogue will be italicized. 
The random pieces of broken English will be bold for emphasis. EVELYN No. Don’t even ask. WAYMOND I know better than to ask to help you. 
But, is now a good time to talk about something else? He nervously clutches some paperwork with colored tabs poking out. 2. 
EVELYN I'm listening. Talk. Evelyn grabs the papers, but he quickly snatches it back. 
WAYMOND I know you aren’t … just let me know when would be better The rice cooker BEEP BEEP BEEPS.
 Without really taking her eyes off her work, she opens the rice cooker, stirs the steaming rice before shutting it and getting back to work.
 EVELYN Later. Maybe. I need to finish this before my father wakes up. Go steam the table cloths for tonight. Then paint over the ceiling water stain. 
She gets a text message on her laptop. The sound of a POT OF WATER BOILING OVER in the kitchen. WAYMOND Already did. Also, I just talked to Byron about tonight.
 The men’s choir have a very fun surprise for- EVELYN Noodles. Put in the noodles. Waymond rushes into the kitchen to tend to the pot. 
WAYMOND (O.S.) So we’ll talk later, like this afternoon? After our appointment
